## Recommendations

### WSL for Windows Users
It is recommended that Windows users first [install Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). The recommended Linux distribution to use is Ubuntu 20.04.  Learn more about WSL and the benefits it provides via [this short interactive course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/)


### Visual Studio Code
If you do not already have a preferred text editor that you use for programming, it is recommended that you [install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  

In addition, you may find the following VS Code plugins useful:
* [solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity)
* [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur)
* [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
* [Apollo GraphQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo&ssr=false#overview)

### GitHub
If you do not already have a GitHub account, it is recommended that you [create one](https://github.com/join) and [add an SSH key to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

### MetaMask
[Install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html) in your browser and create an Ethereum address.  It is recommended to create a new account exclusively for testing purposes that will never hold any mainnet balances.

### Rinkeby ETH
Use the [Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) to populate your testing address with Rinkeby ETH.
